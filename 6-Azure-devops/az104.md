The application is running slowly, and you need to increase the VM size to provide more CPU and memory. However, this application cannot afford much downtime. How do you minimize downtime during the VM size upgrade?

**Answer**: 
To minimize downtime during a VM size upgrade, you should:
1. **Check if a size change requires a VM restart**. Not all VM size changes require a restart. If the size you’re changing to is in the same VM series and SKU, it may not need a restart.
2. **Resize via Azure Portal or PowerShell**:
   - **Azure Portal**: Navigate to the VM, go to "Size," and select a larger size that fits your needs.
   - **Azure CLI**: Use the command `az vm resize --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --size Standard_DS3_v2`.
   
If a restart is required (due to a change in series or SKU):
- **Use a load balancer**: If this is part of a high-availability setup (e.g., two VMs behind a load balancer), you can resize one VM at a time, ensuring the application is always running on the other instance.
- **Plan for scheduled downtime**: If it’s not possible to avoid a restart, notify the stakeholders and schedule a maintenance window for the change.

---

### **Scenario 2: Diagnosing Connectivity Issues**
