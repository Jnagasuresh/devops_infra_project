# Volumes:

## Types of volumes
hostPath (k8s) ----- bindmount (docker)
emptydir (k8s) ----- tmpfs (docker)
volumes (k8s) ----- volumes (docker)

## Provisinings:

### there are 2 types of provisinings
 * Static type -> someone creates and I use it
 * Dynamic type

 * Persistent volumes (PV) are at cluster level
 * Persistent volume claims(pvc) are at namespace level.

 * Pv and PVC has one to one binding

 [volumes](/docs/svc_volume.pdf)
![Big Picture](/images/storage.png)

* PersistentVolumes (PV)
* PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)
* StorageClasses (SC)

* While creating the PV, few important things I need 
    name:
    size: 10
    AccessMode: ReadWriteOnce (RWO), ReadOnlyMany, ReadWriteMany (RWX), ReadWriteOncePod

    ![Pv to Pvc flow](/images/PV-Pvc.png)

* Host Path Volume
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: host-pod
spec:
    containers:
        - image: busybox
          name: busybox
          command: ["sh","-c", "echo Success!!! > /output/success.txt"]
          volumeMounts:
            - name: my-volume
              mountPath: /output
    volumes:
        - name: my-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /var/data        
```

* PersistentVolumeReClaimPolicy
  - Retain -- Keep all data
  - Delete --> delete the underlying storage resource automatically (only work in cloud storage resource)
  - Recycle --> delete all the data inthe underlying storage resource

* Persistent Volume

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
    name: pvvol-1
spec:
    # disk size, access mode,
    capacity:
        storage:1Gi
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
    persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
    # Type of volume for underlying storage. hostpath, nfs, ebs...
    nfs:
        server: 35.184.125.185
        path: /opt/sfw
```

```
 kubectl get pv
```

## PVC
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
    name: boutique-pvc
spec:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
    resources:
        requests:
            storage: 500Mi
```

* The binding between pv and pvc is based on accessModes. if accessModes match, then pv and pvc are binded each other

## Respective deployment
![claiming pv](/images/PV-pvc-pod.png)
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
  name: pvc-deploy
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: cart
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: cart
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: busybox
        name: busybox
        command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do echo Siva!!! >> /output/output.txt; sleep 5; done"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: my-volume
          mountPath: /output
      volumes:
      - name: my-volume
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: boutique-pv

```

* to debug inside the pod use below command
```
kubectl exec -it <pod_name> /bin/bash

to debug inside output directory
cd /output/
```

## Dynamic provisiong

### Storage Class
  - it will allo k8s admin to specifigy the type of storage service they offer on the k8s

```
  ~/.kube/config
  ```

  ## Storage Class
  ![gcp storage class object by default](/images/gcp_storageclass.png)

* below snipppet it for Storage class
  ```
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.ip/v1
    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
    name: gold
    provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
    allowVolumeExpansion: true
    parameters:
    type: pd-ssd

  ```
  
 <p>
 __allowVolumeExpansion__ property from above manifest is helping to expand the size on demand basis, with out this attribute, once memory is full with existing size, memory can't expand.
 </p>

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: pvc-claim
  spec:
    accessModes:
    -  ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 20Gi
  ```
* When dynamic volume allocation, once storage class is created, one can directly create the PVC, System will automatically creates the respective PV and binding.

* So in Static type,
  - Storage admin creates nfs stroage slots (external)
  - K8s Admin would responsible to create PV's (persistenet volues) at cluster level
  - PVC (persistent volume claims) will be created at name space level.
  - Volumes are created in Pod's
  - Volume mounts will be created at Container level
![Static Volume](/images/Static_Volume.png)

### Mappings
* External to PV --> Use storage type in PV
* PV to PVC    --> mapping is will happen based on accessMode
* PVC  to  POD --> mapping happens based on pvc name in POD manifest
* POD to Container -> volumeMount attribut.


* In Dynamic provising
 - Storage class will be created 
 - Then create PVC's at name space levle, PV will be created automatically
 - Volumes are created in Pod's
  - Volume mounts will be created at Container level

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: pvc-claim
  spec:
    storageClassName: "gold"
    accessModes:
    -  ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 20Gi
  ```

  ```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadatq:
  name: busybox-pod-default
spec:
  Containers:
  -  image: busybox
     name: busybox
     command:['sh','-c','while true; do echo nagas!!! >> /output/output.txt; sleep 5; done']
     volumeMounts:
     -  mountPath: /output/
        name: my-cloud
  volumes:
  -  name: my-cloud
     persistentVolumeClaim:
       claimName: pvc-claim
  ```

  ## Configure Your .NET API to Write Logs to the Mounted Volume

  Ensure your .NET API is configured to write logs to the /app/logs directory, which is mounted to the Kubernetes volume.

In your .NET application, configure logging to write to a file in the /app/logs directory. For example, using Serilog:

```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Serilog;
using Serilog.Events;
using System.IO;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
            .MinimumLevel.Debug()
            .MinimumLevel.Override("Microsoft", LogEventLevel.Information)
            .Enrich.FromLogContext()
            .WriteTo.Console()
            .WriteTo.File("/app/logs/log-.txt", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)
            .CreateLogger();

        try
        {
            Log.Information("Starting web host");
            CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Log.Fatal(ex, "Host terminated unexpectedly");
        }
        finally
        {
            Log.CloseAndFlush();
        }
    }

    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .UseSerilog() // Add this line
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
            {
                webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            });
}
```

## Various types of Volumes supported in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, there are several types of volumes available, each suited to different use cases. Hereâ€™s an overview of the main volume types, their use cases, and considerations for when not to use them:

### 1. EmptyDir
**Description**: A volume that is initially empty and is created when a pod is assigned to a node. It exists as long as the pod runs on that node.
**Use Cases**:
- Temporary storage for data that needs to be shared among containers in a pod.
- Cache or scratch space for applications.
**When Not to Use**:
- When you need data to persist beyond the lifecycle of the pod.
- For critical data that must survive pod restarts or failures.

### 2. HostPath
**Description**: A volume that mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into your pod.
**Use Cases**:
- Accessing specific files on the host system.
- Debugging or administrative tasks.
**When Not to Use**:
- For applications that require portability across different nodes (HostPath ties your pod to a specific node).
- In multi-tenant environments due to potential security risks.

### 3. GCEPersistentDisk / AWSElasticBlockStore / AzureDisk
**Description**: Cloud provider-specific storage volumes that persist data even after the pod is deleted.
**Use Cases**:
- Persistent storage for applications running in a specific cloud environment (GCP, AWS, Azure).
**When Not to Use**:
- In a hybrid or multi-cloud environment where portability is required.
- If you are looking for a cloud-agnostic storage solution.

### 4. NFS (Network File System)
**Description**: A volume that mounts an NFS share.
**Use Cases**:
- Shared storage between multiple pods across nodes.
- Centralized storage solutions for applications that need to share data.
**When Not to Use**:
- For performance-sensitive applications (NFS can introduce latency).
- In environments where NFS is not supported or desired.

### 5. PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)
**Description**: An abstraction that allows dynamic provisioning of storage based on defined storage classes.
**Use Cases**:
- General-purpose storage that needs to be dynamically provisioned.
- Environments requiring decoupling of storage and compute resources.
**When Not to Use**:
- Situations where static provisioning is more appropriate.
- Very simple applications where the overhead of managing PVCs is unnecessary.

### 6. ConfigMap
**Description**: A volume that provides configuration data to applications.
**Use Cases**:
- Injecting configuration files or environment variables into pods.
- Storing configuration data that can be consumed by containers at runtime.
**When Not to Use**:
- For storing sensitive data (use Secrets instead).
- For large binary files (ConfigMaps are intended for small to medium-sized text data).

### 7. Secret
**Description**: A volume that provides sensitive data, such as passwords, tokens, or keys.
**Use Cases**:
- Storing and injecting sensitive configuration data securely into pods.
**When Not to Use**:
- For non-sensitive configuration data (use ConfigMap instead).
- If not using Kubernetes' native secret management and encryption features.

### 8. CSI (Container Storage Interface)
**Description**: A standard interface for exposing storage systems to containers.
**Use Cases**:
- Integrating third-party storage solutions with Kubernetes.
- Leveraging advanced storage features provided by CSI drivers.
**When Not to Use**:
- If your storage provider does not support CSI.
- For very simple storage needs where a native Kubernetes volume type suffices.

### 9. PersistentVolume (PV)
**Description**: A piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using a StorageClass.
**Use Cases**:
- When you need to manage storage independently of the lifecycle of pods.
- Scenarios requiring pre-provisioned storage.
**When Not to Use**:
- For ephemeral storage needs (use EmptyDir instead).
- If the application doesnâ€™t require persistent data.

### 10. DownwardAPI
**Description**: A volume that makes downward API data (such as pod and container fields) available to applications.
**Use Cases**:
- Exposing metadata about the pod or container to the application.
- Injecting configuration data from the pod spec into the application.
**When Not to Use**:
- For general-purpose storage.
- When the application doesnâ€™t need to access pod/container metadata.

### Summary

Choosing the right volume type depends on your application's requirements, infrastructure, and operational considerations. Here's a quick summary:

- **Use for Temporary Storage**: `emptyDir`
- **Node-Specific Data**: `hostPath`
- **Cloud-Specific Persistent Storage**: `gcePersistentDisk`, `awsElasticBlockStore`, `azureDisk`, `azureFile`
- **Distributed and Networked File Systems**: `nfs`, `glusterfs`, `cephfs`
- **Configuration and Sensitive Data**: `configMap`, `secret`
- **Portable and Persistent Storage**: `persistentVolumeClaim`

Avoid using volumes that are tied to specific infrastructure if you aim for portability, and avoid using temporary volumes like `emptyDir` for data that needs to persist beyond the lifecycle of a pod.

When using managed Kubernetes clusters like AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), or EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service), the default behavior and capabilities regarding persistent storage depend on the specific type of storage used. Here's an overview of how GCEPersistentDisk, AWSElasticBlockStore, and AzureDisk work with respect to storage access modes and their use cases:

### GCEPersistentDisk (GKE)
**Storage Type**: Persistent Disk (PD)
**Access Modes**:
- **ReadWriteOnce (RWO)**: Can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
- **ReadOnlyMany (ROX)**: Can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.

**Use Cases**:
- **RWO**: Typically used for applications that require exclusive write access, such as databases.
- **ROX**: Suitable for applications that need to share data across multiple nodes but do not need write access, like configuration data or static assets.

**Managed Clusters**:
- **RWO**: Each pod that needs write access to the storage will require its own PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). Pods using the same PV with RWO must be scheduled on the same node.
- **ROX**: Multiple pods can share the same PV, but only for read-only access.

### AWSElasticBlockStore (EKS)
**Storage Type**: Elastic Block Store (EBS)
**Access Modes**:
- **ReadWriteOnce (RWO)**: Can be mounted as read-write by a single node.

**Use Cases**:
- **RWO**: Ideal for applications needing exclusive write access. Similar use cases to GCEPersistentDisk.

**Managed Clusters**:
- **RWO**: Each pod requiring write access needs its own PV and PVC. Pods using the same PV with RWO must be scheduled on the same node.

### AzureDisk (AKS)
**Storage Type**: Managed Disks
**Access Modes**:
- **ReadWriteOnce (RWO)**: Can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
- **ReadOnlyMany (ROX)**: Can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.

**Use Cases**:
- **RWO**: Suitable for applications that need exclusive write access.
- **ROX**: Used for applications needing read-only access from multiple nodes.

**Managed Clusters**:
- **RWO**: Each pod needing write access requires its own PV and PVC. Pods using the same PV with RWO must be scheduled on the same node.
- **ROX**: Multiple pods can share the same PV for read-only access.

### ReadWriteMany (RWX) Support
The `ReadWriteMany (RWX)` access mode, which allows a volume to be mounted as read-write by many nodes simultaneously, is not supported by GCEPersistentDisk, AWSElasticBlockStore, or AzureDisk. If you need RWX functionality, you can consider the following storage solutions that support RWX:

1. **NFS (Network File System)**:
   - Allows sharing volumes across multiple nodes with RWX.
   - Suitable for shared data, configurations, and user-generated content.

2. **AzureFile (AKS)**:
   - Provides SMB-based file share.
   - Supports RWX and can be mounted across multiple nodes.

3. **Amazon EFS (EKS)**:
   - Provides Elastic File System.
   - Supports RWX and can be mounted across multiple nodes.

4. **Google Cloud Filestore (GKE)**:
   - Provides managed NFS storage.
   - Supports RWX and can be mounted across multiple nodes.

### Summary
- **RWO** (ReadWriteOnce): Each pod needing write access requires its own PV and PVC. This is supported by GCEPersistentDisk, AWSElasticBlockStore, and AzureDisk.
- **ROX** (ReadOnlyMany): Multiple pods can share the same PV for read-only access. Supported by GCEPersistentDisk and AzureDisk.
- **RWX** (ReadWriteMany): Requires storage solutions like NFS, AzureFile, Amazon EFS, or Google Cloud Filestore, which support shared read-write access across multiple nodes.

In managed Kubernetes environments, for applications requiring shared write access, you should use storage solutions specifically designed to support RWX.

### Common K8s Volume issues
### Common Issues with Kubernetes Volumes and Their Solutions

When using Kubernetes volumes, several common issues can arise, ranging from misconfiguration to performance problems. Here are some of the most general issues encountered with Kubernetes volumes, along with their solutions:

#### 1. Volume Mount Failures
**Issue**: Pods fail to start because the volume cannot be mounted.
**Common Causes**:
- The PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is not correctly bound to a PersistentVolume (PV).
- The PV does not exist or is not available.
- Misconfigured access modes or storage class.

**Solutions**:
- **Ensure PVC and PV are Bound**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pvc
  kubectl get pv
  ```
  Check that the PVC status is `Bound`. If not, verify the PVC and PV specifications.
  
- **Verify PV Availability**:
  Make sure the PV is created and has enough capacity and the correct access modes.

- **Check Storage Class**:
  Ensure the storage class specified in the PVC matches the available storage classes.

- **Logs and Events**:
  Check pod events and logs for more details:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```

#### 2. ReadWriteMany (RWX) Not Supported
**Issue**: Need to share volumes across multiple nodes with read-write access, but the default volume types like GCEPersistentDisk, AWSElasticBlockStore, and AzureDisk do not support RWX.
**Common Causes**: Using volume types that only support ReadWriteOnce (RWO).

**Solutions**:
- **Use NFS (Network File System)**:
  Set up an NFS server and use NFS volumes:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolume
  metadata:
    name: nfs-pv
  spec:
    capacity:
      storage: 10Gi
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteMany
    nfs:
      path: /path/to/nfs
      server: nfs-server.example.com
  ```

  - **AzureFile**: For AKS clusters.
  - **Google Cloud Filestore**: For GKE clusters.

#### 3. Performance Issues
**Issue**: Application performance is degraded due to slow storage.
**Common Causes**: Using inappropriate storage types for performance-sensitive applications.

**Solutions**:
- **Use SSD-based Storage**:
  Ensure you are using SSD-based storage if high IOPS and low latency are required.

- **Tune Storage Parameters**:
  Configure appropriate storage class parameters for performance.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
  kind: StorageClass
  metadata:
    name: fast
  provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
  parameters:
    type: pd-ssd
  ```

- **Monitor and Optimize**:
  Use tools like `iostat`, `fio`, and Kubernetes monitoring solutions (Prometheus, Grafana) to monitor and optimize performance.

#### 4. Data Persistence Issues
**Issue**: Data loss due to ephemeral nature of certain volume types or misconfigured persistent volumes.
**Common Causes**: Using EmptyDir for data that needs to persist, incorrect PV/PVC configurations.

**Solutions**:
- **Use Persistent Volumes**:
  Ensure critical data is stored on persistent volumes.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolume
  metadata:
    name: persistent-volume
  spec:
    capacity:
      storage: 10Gi
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
    gcePersistentDisk:
      pdName: my-pd
      fsType: ext4
  ```

- **Backup and Restore**:
  Implement regular backup and restore processes using tools like Velero.

#### 5. Access Permissions Issues
**Issue**: Pods cannot access volumes due to permission issues.
**Common Causes**: Incorrect file permissions or security context settings.

**Solutions**:
- **Set Correct Permissions**:
  Ensure that the directory and files within the volume have the correct permissions.
  ```bash
  chmod -R 777 /mnt/data
  ```

- **Use Security Context**:
  Configure the security context in the pod spec to ensure the container runs with the correct user and group.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: mypod
  spec:
    securityContext:
      fsGroup: 2000
    containers:
    - name: mycontainer
      image: busybox
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000
  ```

### Summary
