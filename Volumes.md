# Volumes:

## Types of volumes
* hostPath (k8s) ----- bindmount (docker)
* emptydir (k8s) ----- tmpfs (docker)
* volumes (k8s) ----- volumes (docker)

## Provisinings:

### There are 2 types of provisinings
 * Static type -> someone creates and I use it
 * Dynamic type

 * Persistent volumes (PV) are at cluster level
 * Persistent volume claims(pvc) are at namespace level.

 * Pv and PVC has one to one binding

* Host Path Volume
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: host-pod
spec:
    containers:
        - image: busybox
          name: busybox
          command: ["sh","-c", "echo Success!!! > /output/success.txt"]
          volumeMounts:
            - name: my-volume
              mountPath: /output
    volumes:

```

* PersistentVolumeReClaimPolicy
  - Retain -- Keep all data
  - Delete --> delete the underlying storage resource automatically (only work in cloud storage resource)
  - Recycle --> delete all the data inthe underlying storage resource

 a **PersistentVolumeReclaimPolicy** is a policy that determines what happens to a PersistentVolume (PV) when its associated PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is deleted. This policy is set on the PV and controls the volume's lifecycle after the PVC has released it.

 ### Types of PersistentVolumeReclaimPolicy

Kubernetes supports three main types of reclaim policies for PersistentVolumes:

1. **Retain**
2. **Delete**
3. **Recycle** (Deprecated)


#### 1. Retain

- **Description:** The `Retain` policy ensures that the PersistentVolume and its data are preserved after the associated PVC is deleted. The volume is disassociated from the claim, but the data remains intact and the volume is not automatically made available for new claims.
- **Use Case:** Suitable when you want to preserve the data for manual backup, audit, or reuse purposes. After a PVC is deleted, an administrator must manually reclaim the volume, reattach it to another PVC, or clean up the data.
- **Consideration:** With the `Retain` policy, administrators have to handle the cleanup or manual reassignment of the PersistentVolume.

#### 2. Delete

- **Description:** The `Delete` policy automatically deletes the PersistentVolume and the associated storage resource (like an AWS EBS volume, Google Cloud Disk, or Azure Disk) when the PVC is deleted. This policy is useful for temporary data storage that does not need to be preserved.
- **Use Case:** Commonly used in environments where data does not need to be retained after the pod using it is terminated, such as for scratch space, temporary data, or non-critical applications.
- **Consideration:** This policy results in the loss of data on the volume upon PVC deletion, so it should be used when data retention is not required.

#### 3. Recycle (Deprecated)

- **Description:** The `Recycle` policy would scrub the data on the PersistentVolume (i.e., delete all files) and make the volume available for new PVCs to claim. However, this policy is deprecated and not recommended for use in newer Kubernetes versions.
- **Use Case:** Previously used for simple use cases where data scrubbing was sufficient before making the volume available again. Replaced by more secure and flexible data management practices.
- **Consideration:** Since `Recycle` is deprecated, it is recommended to use other methods for managing PV lifecycle and data sanitization.

### Choosing the Right Reclaim Policy

- **Data Sensitivity:** If the data is sensitive or must be preserved, use `Retain` and manage the volume manually.
- **Cost Considerations:** Use `Delete` if you want to automatically clean up resources and reduce costs.
- **Security:** Ensure secure handling of data, especially with policies that involve automatic deletion or data scrubbing.

Selecting the appropriate `PersistentVolumeReclaimPolicy` depends on your applicationâ€™s data retention needs, security requirements, and operational practices.

* Persistent Volume

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
    name: pvvol-1
spec:
    # disk size, access mode,
    capacity:
        storage:1Gi
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
    persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
    # Type of volume for underlying storage. hostpath, nfs, ebs...
    nfs:
        server: 35.184.125.185

```

```
 kubectl get pv
```

## PVC
```
apiVersion: v1

* The binding between pv and pvc is based on accessModes. if accessModes match, then pv and pvc are binded each other

## Respective deployment

        command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do echo Siva!!! >> /output/output.txt; sleep 5; done"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: my-volume
          mountPath: /output
      volumes:
      - name: my-volume
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: boutique-pv

```

* To debug inside the pod use below command
```
kubectl exec -it <pod_name> /bin/bash

to debug inside output directory
cd /output/
```

## Dynamic provisiong

### Storage Class
  - it will allo k8s admin to specifigy the type of storage service they offer on the k8s
  - storage class volumes are immutable
```
  ~/.kube/config
  ```

  ## Storage Class
  ![gcp storage class object by default](/images/gcp_storageclass.png)

* Below snipppet it for Storage class
  ```
  apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
  kind: StorageClass
  metadata:
    name: gold
  provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
  allowVolumeExpansion: true
  parameters:
    type: pd-ssd

  ```
  
 <p>
 **allowVolumeExpansion** property from above manifest is helping to expand the size on demand basis, with out this attribute, once memory is full with existing size, memory can't expand.
 </p>

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: pvc-claim
  spec:
    accessModes:
    -  ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 20Gi
  ```

* When dynamic volume allocation, once storage class is created, one can directly create the PVC, System will automatically creates the respective PV and binding.

* So in Static type,
  - Storage admin creates nfs stroage slots (external)
  - K8s Admin would responsible to create PV's (persistenet volues) at cluster level
  - PVC (persistent volume claims) will be created at name space level.
  - Volumes are created in Pod's
  - Volume mounts will be created at Container level
![Static Volume](/images/Static_Volume.png)

### Mappings
* External to PV --> Use storage type in PV
* PV to PVC    --> mapping is will happen based on accessMode
* PVC  to  POD --> mapping happens based on pvc name in POD manifest
* POD to Container -> volumeMount attribut.


* In Dynamic provising
 - Storage class will be created 
 - Then create PVC's at name space levle, PV will be created automatically
 - Volumes are created in Pod's
  - Volume mounts will be created at Container level

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: pvc-claim
  spec:
    storageClassName: "gold"
    accessModes:
    -  ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 20Gi
  ```

  ```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod

  ## Configure Your .NET API to Write Logs to the Mounted Volume

  Ensure your .NET API is configured to write logs to the /app/logs directory, which is mounted to the Kubernetes volume.

In your .NET application, configure logging to write to a file in the /app/logs directory. For example, using Serilog:

```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Serilog;
using Serilog.Events;
using System.IO;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
            .MinimumLevel.Debug()
            .MinimumLevel.Override("Microsoft", LogEventLevel.Information)
            .Enrich.FromLogContext()
            .WriteTo.Console()
            .WriteTo.File("/app/logs/log-.txt", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)
            .CreateLogger();

        try
        {
            Log.Information("Starting web host");
            CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Log.Fatal(ex, "Host terminated unexpectedly");
        }
        finally
        {
            Log.CloseAndFlush();
        }
    }

    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .UseSerilog() // Add this line
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
            {
                webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            });
}
```

In Kubernetes, PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) are used to manage storage resources. The distinction between static and dynamic provisioning types affects how these resources are created and managed. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the differences in the context of static and dynamic volume provisioning:

### Static Volume Provisioning

**PersistentVolume (PV):**
- **Manual Creation:** In static provisioning, the PVs are created manually by an administrator before they are used by any PVCs. This involves specifying the storage details like size, access modes, and the underlying storage resource.
- **Pre-defined:** The details of the PV, including its size and storage class, are pre-defined and cannot be changed once set.
- **Binding:** When a PVC is created, it must match the criteria (such as storage capacity and access mode) of an existing PV for binding to occur. The administrator must ensure that PVs are available and match the requirements of the PVCs that will claim them.

**PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):**
- **Manual Request:** A PVC is a request for storage by a user or application. It specifies the desired storage size, access modes, and optionally, the storage class.
- **Binding Process:** Kubernetes matches a PVC to a suitable existing PV. If a matching PV is found, the PVC is bound to it. If no suitable PV is available, the PVC remains unbound until an appropriate PV is created.
- **Predefined Matching:** The PVC relies on manually created PVs being available. The storage size and characteristics must be predetermined and carefully managed.

### Dynamic Volume Provisioning
![Dynamic Volume flow](/images/volumesflow.png)
* 6. The SC creates the PV and maps it tothe EBS volume on the AWS back end
* 7. The pod mounts the PV and uses it

**PersistentVolume (PV):**
- **Automatic Creation:** In dynamic provisioning, the PVs are automatically created by Kubernetes when a PVC is made. The creation of the PV is handled by a storage provisioner that understands the storage backend.
- **On-Demand:** PVs are not pre-created; instead, they are provisioned as needed, based on the specifications in the PVC and the associated StorageClass.
- **Flexibility:** This method allows for more flexible and scalable storage management, as the PVs are created to match the exact specifications requested by the PVCs.

**PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):**
- **Dynamic Request:** Similar to static provisioning, a PVC specifies the required storage size, access modes, and storage class. However, with dynamic provisioning, the PVC also triggers the creation of the PV.
- **StorageClass Dependency:** The PVC must specify a StorageClass, which defines the storage type, parameters, and the provisioner to be used. The StorageClass handles the details of PV creation.
- **Automated Binding:** Once the PV is created by the provisioner, it is automatically bound to the PVC. This simplifies the user's experience, as they do not need to worry about the availability of matching PVs.

### Key Differences Between Static and Dynamic Provisioning

1. **Provisioning Method:**
   - **Static:** PVs are manually created and managed by administrators.
   - **Dynamic:** PVs are automatically created when PVCs are made, based on a predefined StorageClass.

2. **Flexibility:**
   - **Static:** Less flexible, as PVs must exist before PVCs can bind to them, and changes require manual intervention.
   - **Dynamic:** More flexible, with on-demand provisioning tailored to the needs of PVCs.

3. **Management Overhead:**
   - **Static:** Higher, requiring careful planning and management of storage resources and PV-PVC matching.
   - **Dynamic:** Lower, as the system handles PV creation and management, reducing the need for manual intervention.

4. **Scalability:**
   - **Static:** May face limitations in scalability, especially in environments with dynamic or unpredictable storage needs.
   - **Dynamic:** Better suited for environments that require scalability and flexibility, such as cloud-native applications or microservices architectures.

## Various types of Volumes supported in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, there are several types of volumes available, each suited to different use cases. Hereâ€™s an overview of the main volume types, their use cases, and considerations for when not to use them:

### 1. EmptyDir
**Description**: A volume that is initially empty and is created when a pod is assigned to a node. It exists as long as the pod runs on that node.
**Use Cases**:
- Temporary storage for data that needs to be shared among containers in a pod.
- Cache or scratch space for applications.
**When Not to Use**:
- When you need data to persist beyond the lifecycle of the pod.
- For critical data that must survive pod restarts or failures.

### 2. HostPath
**Description**: A volume that mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into your pod.
**Use Cases**:
- Accessing specific files on the host system.
- Debugging or administrative tasks.
**When Not to Use**:
- For applications that require portability across different nodes (HostPath ties your pod to a specific node).
- In multi-tenant environments due to potential security risks.

### 3. GCEPersistentDisk / AWSElasticBlockStore / AzureDisk
**Description**: Cloud provider-specific storage volumes that persist data even after the pod is deleted.
**Use Cases**:
- Persistent storage for applications running in a specific cloud environment (GCP, AWS, Azure).
**When Not to Use**:
- In a hybrid or multi-cloud environment where portability is required.
- If you are looking for a cloud-agnostic storage solution.

### 4. NFS (Network File System)
**Description**: A volume that mounts an NFS share.
**Use Cases**:
- Shared storage between multiple pods across nodes.
- Centralized storage solutions for applications that need to share data.
**When Not to Use**:
- For performance-sensitive applications (NFS can introduce latency).
- In environments where NFS is not supported or desired.

### 5. PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)
**Description**: An abstraction that allows dynamic provisioning of storage based on defined storage classes.
**Use Cases**:
- General-purpose storage that needs to be dynamically provisioned.
- Environments requiring decoupling of storage and compute resources.
**When Not to Use**:
- Situations where static provisioning is more appropriate.
- Very simple applications where the overhead of managing PVCs is unnecessary.

### 6. ConfigMap
**Description**: A volume that provides configuration data to applications.
**Use Cases**:
- Injecting configuration files or environment variables into pods.
- Storing configuration data that can be consumed by containers at runtime.
**When Not to Use**:
- For storing sensitive data (use Secrets instead).
- For large binary files (ConfigMaps are intended for small to medium-sized text data).

### 7. Secret
**Description**: A volume that provides sensitive data, such as passwords, tokens, or keys.
**Use Cases**:
- Storing and injecting sensitive configuration data securely into pods.
**When Not to Use**:
- For non-sensitive configuration data (use ConfigMap instead).
- If not using Kubernetes' native secret management and encryption features.

### 8. CSI (Container Storage Interface)
**Description**: A standard interface for exposing storage systems to containers.
**Use Cases**:
- Integrating third-party storage solutions with Kubernetes.
- Leveraging advanced storage features provided by CSI drivers.
**When Not to Use**:
- If your storage provider does not support CSI.
- For very simple storage needs where a native Kubernetes volume type suffices.

### 9. PersistentVolume (PV)
**Description**: A piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using a StorageClass.
**Use Cases**:
- When you need to manage storage independently of the lifecycle of pods.
- Scenarios requiring pre-provisioned storage.
**When Not to Use**:
- For ephemeral storage needs (use EmptyDir instead).
- If the application doesnâ€™t require persistent data.

### 10. DownwardAPI
**Description**: A volume that makes downward API data (such as pod and container fields) available to applications.
**Use Cases**:
- Exposing metadata about the pod or container to the application.
- Injecting configuration data from the pod spec into the application.
**When Not to Use**:
- For general-purpose storage.
- When the application doesnâ€™t need to access pod/container metadata.

- **Configuration and Sensitive Data**: `configMap`, `secret`
- **Portable and Persistent Storage**: `persistentVolumeClaim`

Avoid using volumes that are tied to specific infrastructure if you aim for portability, and avoid using temporary volumes like `emptyDir` for data that needs to persist beyond the lifecycle of a pod.

When using managed Kubernetes clusters like AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), or EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service), the default behavior and capabilities regarding persistent storage depend on the specific type of storage used. Here's an overview of how GCEPersistentDisk, AWSElasticBlockStore, and AzureDisk work with respect to storage access modes and their use cases:

### GCEPersistentDisk (GKE)
**Storage Type**: Persistent Disk (PD)
**Access Modes**:
- **ReadWriteOnce (RWO)**: Can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
- **ReadOnlyMany (ROX)**: Can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.

**Use Cases**:
- **RWO**: Typically used for applications that require exclusive write access, such as databases.
- **ROX**: Suitable for applications that need to share data across multiple nodes but do not need write access, like configuration data or static assets.

**Managed Clusters**:
- **RWO**: Each pod that needs write access to the storage will require its own PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). Pods using the same PV with RWO must be scheduled on the same node.
- **ROX**: Multiple pods can share the same PV, but only for read-only access.

### AWSElasticBlockStore (EKS)
**Storage Type**: Elastic Block Store (EBS)
**Access Modes**:
- **ReadWriteOnce (RWO)**: Can be mounted as read-write by a single node.

**Use Cases**:
- **RWO**: Ideal for applications needing exclusive write access. Similar use cases to GCEPersistentDisk.

**Managed Clusters**:
- **RWO**: Each pod requiring write access needs its own PV and PVC. Pods using the same PV with RWO must be scheduled on the same node.

### AzureDisk (AKS)
**Storage Type**: Managed Disks
**Access Modes**:
- **ReadWriteOnce (RWO)**: Can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
- **ReadOnlyMany (ROX)**: Can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.

**Use Cases**:
- **RWO**: Suitable for applications that need exclusive write access.
- **ROX**: Used for applications needing read-only access from multiple nodes.

**Managed Clusters**:
- **RWO**: Each pod needing write access requires its own PV and PVC. Pods using the same PV with RWO must be scheduled on the same node.
- **ROX**: Multiple pods can share the same PV for read-only access.

### ReadWriteMany (RWX) Support
The `ReadWriteMany (RWX)` access mode, which allows a volume to be mounted as read-write by many nodes simultaneously, is not supported by GCEPersistentDisk, AWSElasticBlockStore, or AzureDisk. If you need RWX functionality, you can consider the following storage solutions that support RWX:

1. **NFS (Network File System)**:
   - Allows sharing volumes across multiple nodes with RWX.
   - Suitable for shared data, configurations, and user-generated content.

2. **AzureFile (AKS)**:
   - Provides SMB-based file share.
   - Supports RWX and can be mounted across multiple nodes.

3. **Amazon EFS (EKS)**:
   - Provides Elastic File System.
   - Supports RWX and can be mounted across multiple nodes.

4. **Google Cloud Filestore (GKE)**:
   - Provides managed NFS storage.
   - Supports RWX and can be mounted across multiple nodes.

### Summary
- **RWO** (ReadWriteOnce): Each pod needing write access requires its own PV and PVC. This is supported by GCEPersistentDisk, AWSElasticBlockStore, and AzureDisk.
- **ROX** (ReadOnlyMany): Multiple pods can share the same PV for read-only access. Supported by GCEPersistentDisk and AzureDisk.
- **RWX** (ReadWriteMany): Requires storage solutions like NFS, AzureFile, Amazon EFS, or Google Cloud Filestore, which support shared read-write access across multiple nodes.

In managed Kubernetes environments, for applications requiring shared write access, you should use storage solutions specifically designed to support RWX.

### Common K8s Volume issues
### Common Issues with Kubernetes Volumes and Their Solutions

When using Kubernetes volumes, several common issues can arise, ranging from misconfiguration to performance problems. Here are some of the most general issues encountered with Kubernetes volumes, along with their solutions:

#### 1. Volume Mount Failures
**Issue**: Pods fail to start because the volume cannot be mounted.
**Common Causes**:
- The PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is not correctly bound to a PersistentVolume (PV).
- The PV does not exist or is not available.
- Misconfigured access modes or storage class.

**Solutions**:
- **Ensure PVC and PV are Bound**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pvc
  kubectl get pv
  ```
  Check that the PVC status is `Bound`. If not, verify the PVC and PV specifications.
  
- **Verify PV Availability**:
  Make sure the PV is created and has enough capacity and the correct access modes.

- **Check Storage Class**:
  Ensure the storage class specified in the PVC matches the available storage classes.

- **Logs and Events**:
  Check pod events and logs for more details:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```

#### 2. ReadWriteMany (RWX) Not Supported
**Issue**: Need to share volumes across multiple nodes with read-write access, but the default volume types like GCEPersistentDisk, AWSElasticBlockStore, and AzureDisk do not support RWX.
**Common Causes**: Using volume types that only support ReadWriteOnce (RWO).

**Solutions**:
- **Use NFS (Network File System)**:
  Set up an NFS server and use NFS volumes:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolume
  metadata:
    name: nfs-pv
  spec:
    capacity:
      storage: 10Gi
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteMany
    nfs:
      path: /path/to/nfs
      server: nfs-server.example.com
  ```

- **Use Cloud File Storage Solutions**:
  - **AWS EFS**: For EKS clusters.
  - **AzureFile**: For AKS clusters.
  - **Google Cloud Filestore**: For GKE clusters.

#### 3. Performance Issues
**Issue**: Application performance is degraded due to slow storage.
**Common Causes**: Using inappropriate storage types for performance-sensitive applications.

**Solutions**:
- **Use SSD-based Storage**:
  Ensure you are using SSD-based storage if high IOPS and low latency are required.

- **Tune Storage Parameters**:
  Configure appropriate storage class parameters for performance.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
  kind: StorageClass
  metadata:
    name: fast
  provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
  parameters:
    type: pd-ssd
  ```

- **Monitor and Optimize**:
  Use tools like `iostat`, `fio`, and Kubernetes monitoring solutions (Prometheus, Grafana) to monitor and optimize performance.

#### 4. Data Persistence Issues
**Issue**: Data loss due to ephemeral nature of certain volume types or misconfigured persistent volumes.
**Common Causes**: Using EmptyDir for data that needs to persist, incorrect PV/PVC configurations.

**Solutions**:
- **Use Persistent Volumes**:
  Ensure critical data is stored on persistent volumes.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolume
  metadata:
    name: persistent-volume
  spec:
    capacity:
      storage: 10Gi
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
    gcePersistentDisk:
      pdName: my-pd
      fsType: ext4
  ```

- **Backup and Restore**:
  Implement regular backup and restore processes using tools like Velero.

#### 5. Access Permissions Issues
**Issue**: Pods cannot access volumes due to permission issues.
**Common Causes**: Incorrect file permissions or security context settings.

**Solutions**:
- **Set Correct Permissions**:
  Ensure that the directory and files within the volume have the correct permissions.
  ```bash
  chmod -R 777 /mnt/data
  ```

- **Use Security Context**:
  Configure the security context in the pod spec to ensure the container runs with the correct user and group.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: mypod
  spec:
    securityContext:
      fsGroup: 2000
    containers:
    - name: mycontainer
      image: busybox
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000
  ```

### Summary

By understanding these common issues and their solutions, you can ensure more reliable and efficient use of Kubernetes volumes in your applications. Monitoring, proper configuration, and choosing the right storage solution based on your application's needs are key to avoiding and resolving these issues.
